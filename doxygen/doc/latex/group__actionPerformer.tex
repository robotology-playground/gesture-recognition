A module that executes gestures specified in a config file as a set of arm joint positions.  


A module that executes gestures specified in a config file as a set of arm joint positions. 

\hypertarget{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_intro_sec}{}\subsection{Description}\label{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_intro_sec}
This module simply allows the robot to perform a set of gestures that can be specified through a set of arm joint positions as in the file app/conf/actions.\+ini.\hypertarget{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_rpc_port}{}\subsection{Commands\+:}\label{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_rpc_port}
The commands sent as bottles to the module port /$<$mod\+Name$>$/rpc are described in the following\+:

{\bfseries A\+C\+T\+I\+ON} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}action\mbox{]} $<$id$>$ ~\newline
action\+: the module receives the gesture I\+Ds to be performed and execute them.

{\bfseries S\+T\+OP} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}stop\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: the module stops executing the sequence.\hypertarget{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_lib_sec}{}\subsection{Libraries}\label{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_lib_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape /} $<$mod\+Name$>$/rpc remote procedure call. It always replies something.
\item {\itshape /} $<$mod\+Name$>$/out through this port the modules outputs when the execution of the sequence has finished.

The following are the options that are usually contained in the configuration file, which is config.\+ini\+:

--name {\itshape name} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item specify the module name, which is {\itshape action\+Performer} by default.
\end{DoxyItemize}

--robot {\itshape robot} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the robot that should execute the gestures.
\end{DoxyItemize}

--stereo {\itshape stereo} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item it is on when the gesture recognition module based on stereo is being used.

The module that implements the rules of All Gestures You Can game.  


The module that implements the rules of All Gestures You Can game. 

It manages the interactions between gesture\+Recognition and action\+Performer module.\hypertarget{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_intro_sec}{}\subsection{Description}\label{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_intro_sec}
This module manages the interactions between gesture\+Recognition and action\+Performer modules. It keeps track of the turns between the human and the robot, and communicates with both the recognition and the performer modules.\hypertarget{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_rpc_port}{}\subsection{Commands\+:}\label{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_rpc_port}
The commands sent as bottles to the module port /$<$mod\+Name$>$/rpc are described in the following\+:

{\bfseries S\+A\+VE} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}save param\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: this command serves to save all the features in the linear classifier module, for the successive training procedure. param can be a number from 1 to the number of actions that you want to train. This command is used only when the gesture\+Recognition\+Stereo module is running, it is not valid for the gesture\+Recognition using kinect.

{\bfseries T\+R\+A\+I\+N\+ED} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}trained\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: this command is needed to let the linear\+Classifier\+Module train all the gestures saved so far. This command also is valid only for the gesture\+Recognition\+Stereo module, not for the one using kinect.

{\bfseries S\+T\+A\+RT} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}start\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: through this command the game starts. The module chooses the opponent that should start performing a gesture.

{\bfseries W\+IN} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}win\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: this command just communicates that the robot has won and terminates the game.

{\bfseries L\+O\+SE} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}lose\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: this command just communicates that the robot has lost and terminates the game.

{\bfseries O\+V\+ER} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}over\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: this command forcely terminates the game.

{\bfseries D\+O\+NE} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}done\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: this is to notify that the robot has just finished performing the sequence, so it\textquotesingle{}s time for the human to replicate the gestures.

{\bfseries T\+U\+RN} ~\newline
format\+: \mbox{[}turn\mbox{]} ~\newline
action\+: this is to notify the robot that the human has just finished performing the sequence, so it\textquotesingle{}s time for the robot to replicate the gestures.\hypertarget{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_lib_sec}{}\subsection{Libraries}\label{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_lib_sec}

\item Y\+A\+RP libraries.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape /} $<$mod\+Name$>$/rpc remote procedure call. It always replies something.
\item {\itshape /} $<$mod\+Name$>$/performer\+:o it sends the sequence to perform to the action\+Performer module.
\item {\itshape /} $<$mod\+Name$>$/gest\+Rec\+:o it sends command to the gesture\+Recognition module.
\item {\itshape /} $<$mod\+Name$>$/scores\+:i this port reads the recognized gestures.
\item {\itshape /} $<$mod\+Name$>$/outspeak this port sends sentences to the i\+Speak module.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_parameters_sec}{}\subsection{Parameters}\label{group__gestureRecognitionStereo_parameters_sec}
The following are the options that are usually contained in the configuration file, which is config.\+ini\+:

--name {\itshape name} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item specify the module name, which is {\itshape game\+Manager} by default.
\end{DoxyItemize}

--robot {\itshape robot} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the robot that should execute the gestures.
\end{DoxyItemize}

--stereo {\itshape stereo} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item it is on when the gesture recognition module based on stereo is being used.
